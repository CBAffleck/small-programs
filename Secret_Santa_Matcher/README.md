# Secret Santa Matcher

This program allows the user to specify the text file containing a list of names of the people involved in the Secret Santa exchange. The program will output a text file containing matched pairs, e.g, John Smith : Jane Doe.

## Getting Started

Following these instructions will help you get the program running.

### Prerequisites

First make sure you have python2 installed on your computer. Then confirm that a text file containing everyone's names (on separate lines) is in the same directory.

### Running the program

While in the directory with the program and text file, run the following in your terminal:

```
python2 secret-santa-matcher.py
```
You'll see a prompt for the filename of the .txt file you made earlier. Type that in and see what's printed out for the matches.
